    <h2><u>Chandragiri Fort:</u></h2>
    <p>Chandragiri Fort, located in the Chandragiri suburb of Tirupati, is a historic fort built around 1000 AD during the reign of Immadi Narasimha Yadavaraya and later closely associated with the Vijayanagara Empire. Taken over by the Vijayanagara rulers in 1367, it rose to prominence in the 1560s and is linked to Emperor Krishnadevaraya, who stayed there before his coronation. The fort later became the empire’s fourth capital before being annexed by the Golconda Sultanate in 1646 and later passing to the Kingdom of Mysore. Now partly in ruins, it houses the Raja Mahal—an archaeological museum showcasing Vijayanagara architecture—along with the Rani Mahal, eight temples, and other historical structures.</p>
